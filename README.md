# sitepoint-docker-tutorial
Inspired by [https://www.sitepoint.com/docker-php-development-environment/](https://www.sitepoint.com/docker-php-development-environment/)

# How to use
Just run ```docker-compose up``` and you're ready to code

# Improvements
All improvements are for personal use.
1. Used an .env file for variables
2. Nginx root is set to /app ( [127.0.0.1](127.0.0.1) )
3. Added PhpMyAdmin ( [127.0.0.1:8080](127.0.0.1:8080) )

and probably others that I forgot...

Enjoy :)
