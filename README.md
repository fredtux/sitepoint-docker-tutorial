Inspired by [https://www.sitepoint.com/docker-php-development-environment/](https://www.sitepoint.com/docker-php-development-environment/)

# How to use
Just run ```docker-compose up``` and you're ready to code

# Improvements
All improvements are for personal use.
1. Used an .env file for variables
2. Nginx root is set to /app
3. Added PhpMyAdmin

and probably others that I forgot...

Enjoy :)
